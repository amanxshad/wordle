HOW TO PLAY

Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:

**green letter** would mean it is in correct spot
**yellow letter** would mean it is present in word but not in correct spot 
**grey letter** would mean it is not present in word
